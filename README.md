# Honey Production Dataset - EDA

## Dataset
[US Honey Production (1995-2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitpoudel/us-honey-production-19952021)

## Objective
The objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to visualize how honey production has changed over the years (1995â€“2021) in the United States.

## Key Questions
1. **Q1**: How has honey production yield changed from 1995 to 2021? 
2. **Q2**: Over time, what are the major production trends across the states? 
3. **Q3**: Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and the value of production every year? 
4. **Q4**: How has the value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?
