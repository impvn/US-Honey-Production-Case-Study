Honey Production Dataset - EDA
Lets consider a dataset from kaggle and will proceed with an EDA for the same.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitpoudel/us-honey-production-19952021

Objective:
To visualise how honey production is changed over the years (1995â€“2021) in the United States.

Key questions to be answered:

How has honey production yield changed from 1995 to 2021 ?
Over time, what are the major production trends been across the states?
Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production every year? How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed every year?
